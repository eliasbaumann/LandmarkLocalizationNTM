Task from Dagmar:
1. Detect one landmark -> how many training samples?
2. Detect multiple landmarks -> how many training samples?
3. MANNs -> how many training samples?

On 1 and 2:
1. Find a suitable landmark detection strategy which works for low sample count 

On 3:
1. any RCNN to fit into the DNC/MANN model
2. DNC model / MANN model
-> basically we are using simple RCNN for landmark detection OR something even more simple like regular CNN
-> Add either an attetion mechanism or a memory (from MANN or from DNC) to facilitate the meta learning task

Some questions:
- Do we make this a meta learning task straight away? For comparison we likely have to.
- How do we combine cnn+memory ? 
- Do we include the additional Requirement from Stephan -> same distances between certain landmarks or do we ignore?
- Do we detect all landmarks at once?
- Do we even do the whole MANN stuff or de we just find an easier approach to do this?
- We can potentially also compare to https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e72e/852dca333d66559dbcfb050140fac5affe4f.pdf, because we might beat them if detection works very well
